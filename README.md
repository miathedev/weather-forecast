# weather-forecast

weather-forecast is a simple weather dashboard that retrieves data from OpenWeatherMap.
The project is built for a Raspberry Pi 5" screen. It includes a custom 3d-printed case with stand.

- Optimized for 800x480 resolution.
- If you're viewing on a 1920x1080 monitor, zoom the browser to **200%** to approximate the intended element sizes on the Pi display.

## How to setup:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/infinitel8p/weather-forecast.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```shell
cd weather-forecast
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. Configure the Application:
By default, the Electron application loads its configuration from `/etc/weather-forecast/api.conf`. If that file does not exist, it falls back to a local `.env` file in the root directory.

Create the configuration file with the following variables:
- `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` — Your OpenWeatherMap API key (used for all weather data and geocoding)
- `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_VERSION` — The API tier to use:
  - `3.0` (default) — [One Call API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3) (paid subscription)
  - `2.5` — [One Call API 2.5](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) (legacy paid subscription)
  - `free` — Free tier using the standard [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current) + [Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) endpoints (no UV index, 3-hour forecast intervals instead of hourly)
- `LANGUAGE` — UI language: `en` (default) for English or `de` for German.

> [!Note]
> Choose the API version based on your OpenWeatherMap subscription. The `free` option allows you to run the dashboard without a paid subscription, but with limited features.

To override the default config location, use the `--config` parameter:
```shell
# For development
npm run electron:dev -- --config /path/to/your/custom.conf

# For the packaged binary
./dist-electron/linux-unpacked/weather-forecast --config /path/to/your/custom.conf
```

5. Run the Desktop Application:
- **Development Mode (with HMR):**
  ```shell
  npm run electron:dev
  ```
- **Production Mode (local test):**
  ```shell
  npm start
  ```

## Building and Packaging:
To build and package the application into standalone `.deb` and `.AppImage` installers for both **amd64 (x64)** and **arm64** Linux architectures:
```shell
npm run electron:build
```
The compiled binaries will be outputted to the `dist-electron/` folder.

## High-contrast mode

For small or low-quality screens (like the Raspberry Pi 5" touchscreen), a high-contrast variant of the day theme is available. Append `?hc` to the URL to activate it:

```
http://localhost:4321/?hc
http://localhost:4321/setup?hc
```

This increases text contrast, makes cards more opaque, deepens borders, and strengthens the geometric background elements for better readability. The night theme is unaffected.

The case is designed to fit a Raspberry Pi 5" screen. The design files are available on MakerWorld.
